""" The challenge is to implement a function that updates 
missing location info for students attending Northcoders.


Your function should return a new list, 
where all dictionaries that were missing a location 
have been updated so that they now have a location property 
with a value of "remote"."""



# a func APPENDS STRING(location) to a dict 
# call list dict 
# each dict belongs to a NC student 
# some strings have location, some don't 
# return a new LIST with ALL missing locations updated to remote
